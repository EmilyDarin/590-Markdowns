## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Chapter 2 Visualization Notes 

Number 1 lesson I learned: Be patient with R and Yourself 

Making tables and a scatterplot ( )


Load Packages * make sure you download socviz first
```{r}
library(socviz)
library(tidyverse)
```

Create a data frame

```{r}
my_numbers<-c(1,2,3,4)
your_numbers<-c(5,6,7,8)

```
```{r}

```

Basic statistics with the data frame 

```{r}
mean(my_numbers)
```

Summary of the data frame 

```{r}
my_summary <- summary(my_numbers)
my_summary
```

Note: I have been having trouble with means on boxplots, this would be a great alternative to plug in for stat_summary. 

Making a Table

 

```{r}
table(my_numbers)
sd(my_numbers)

```

Making a figure 

```{r}
library(gapminder)
gapminder
```

What is the purpose of mapping?


```{r}
example<-ggplot(data=gapminder, mapping= aes(x=gdpPercap, y= lifeExp) )+ geom_point()

example
```
